🎯 Project Overview

This repository presents my completed task as a Prompt Engineering Intern at Future Interns, focusing on the niche:  
📝 "Documentation Story – Indian Soldiers' Sacrifice"

As part of this AI-powered content challenge, I selected Captain Vikram Batra (PVC) — the Kargil War hero — to develop a 1-minute, emotional, AI-generated video tribute. This project uses generative AI to honor real-world heroes through storytelling, thumbnails, and visual media.
