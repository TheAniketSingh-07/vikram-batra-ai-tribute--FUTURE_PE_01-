🎯 Project Overview

This repository presents my completed task as a Prompt Engineering Intern at Future Interns, focusing on the niche:  
📝 "Documentation Story – Indian Soldiers' Sacrifice"

As part of this AI-powered content challenge, I selected Captain Vikram Batra (PVC) — the Kargil War hero — to develop a 1-minute, emotional, AI-generated video tribute. This project uses generative AI to honor real-world heroes through storytelling, thumbnails, and visual media.

## 📜 Prompts Used

All the AI prompts I crafted and used for scripting, thumbnail generation, and scene planning are saved in the `prompts/` folder.

Sample prompt example:
> “Write a gripping 30-second documentary-style intro about Captain Vikram Batra’s bravery during the Kargil War.”

These prompts demonstrate my thought process and creativity as a Prompt Engineer.
